<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Have you ever tried horseback ridng? Well, that's definetily something on my bucket list. I grew up in Southern Virginia that was considered the country in the northern area where I went to school later in life. I haven't experienced the full country lifetstyle I was designed to live.</p>

<p> Basketball has been a part of my life since I was in middle school. When I got to high school my varisty coaches saw potential in me actually using my voice to coach kids. I am currently looking for a local AAU program to be a part of in texas </p>
